The City of Columbus studied the Frebis Avenue corridor from Bruck Street to Alum Creek Drive in 2022. The study evaluated the feasiblity of reconfiguring the existing roadway to include bike facilities, improving safety for people walking and biking and providing connections between  and conducted a safety analysis.

The Columbus South Side Area Commission extends our full support in moving this project to the next phase and we hope funding for construction can be committed in the near term to improve the safety of this roadway for people walking and biking and reduce vehicle speeds along the corridor. This is a potential major east-west bike corridor.
