The safety of people walking along Lockbourne Road is a major concern of the Columbus South Side Area Commission. There are sidewalk gaps along Lockbourne Road between Frebis Avenue and Marion Road and several portions of the existing sidewalk do not meet accessibility requirements. This section of Lockbourne Road does not have curbs and in several areas features wide swaths of pavement with limited stormwater control and access management. While the intersections of Lockbourne Road with Frebis Avenue and Marion Road have traffic signals, there are no other signalized intersections or marked crosswalks on this nearly one-mile section of Lockbourne Road.
