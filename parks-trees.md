# Parks Improvements 
In 2019, the Public Services Committee visited every park on the South Side and made a list of maintenance needs as well as recommended improvements. Since then, the Columbus Recreation and Parks Department (CRPD) has worked to address the issues and make improvements. 

## Upcoming Improvements
*Updates as of 2/16/2025*

### Fairwood Park Lighting
This will include lighting the park drive and the walking loop at the rear of the park. Construction will occur this year (2025) and is expected to be complete no later than October.
 
### Karns Park Playground Replacement
The playground replacement is currently in design with a package of other playgrounds going through design and permitting. Construction is expected to begin Fall 2025.

### Lincoln Park
Improvements include the addition of new walking path around the eastern greenspace, lighting around entire walking path, addition of new hard surface futsal/multipurpose court behind community center, and drainage improvements. This project is currently in design, with design expected to be completed around August of 2025, with construction to follow with an expected completion date of Fall 2026.

### Deshler Park
Design of a new shelter at Deshler Park is expected to begin later in 2025, with construction currently expected in 2027.

## Completed Improvements
### Millbrook Park
Renovations of the park including new playground, basketball court, benches, etc, is complete.

### Smith Road Park
New playground equipment, fencing, and benches have been installed.

### Southeast Lions Park
Lighting has been installed at the park.

## Additional Requested Improvements
### Moeller Park
Installation of a small shelter with electricty was requested for Moeller Park. CRPD does not have any immediate plans for this improvement but are tracking the request as part of their larger shelter program planning.

### Shelter Houses
A small shelter house with picnic table has been requested for Karns Park, Lincoln Park, Deshler Park, Smith Road Park, and Roosevelt Park. CRPD has included these locations in their plan and prioritized Lincoln Park and Deshler Park because these parks have no existing shelters.

# Street Trees
The South Side's tree canopy is estimated at 18%, below the Citywide average of 22% and well below the City's goal of 40%. Investment in the South Side's tree canopy, especially with the installation of street trees, is a priority.

## Urban Forestry Master Plan
The Urban Forestry Master Plan (UFMP) is a strategic and long-term investment in Columbusâ€™ tree canopy. The South Side has been identified as a priority neighborhood for investment.
