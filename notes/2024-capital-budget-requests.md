Below are the Capital Budget Requests submitted to the City of Columbus by the Columbus South Side Area Commission for 2024. Capital projects relate to physical assets such as roads, sewers and water infrastructure, parkland, fire stations, and much more. While these are the Area Commission's priorities, submission of these priorities does not guarantee the projects will receive funding.

# 1. Barack Recreation Center
**Category**: Recreation and Parks (Parkland and Existing Facilities)

Continued investment in Barack Community Center and Lincoln Park is desired. Specifically, drainage improvements, a walking path, a multipurpose sport court, and the restoration of baseball fields (which previously existed but were removed and never replaced for construction of the elementary school) are desired.

# 2. Lockbourne Road between Frebis Avenue and Marion Road
**Category**: Sidewalks and/or Crosswalks

The safety of people walking along Lockbourne Road is a major concern. Lockbourne Road south of Frebis Ave does not have curbs and lacks sidewalks in several sections. Several sections have parking areas that pull directly off of Lockbourne, further endangering pedestrians. Lockbourne is part of Zone In Phase 1 and is already seeing the construction of affordable housing along the corridor. We think safety improvements to the corridor are vital to support this growth. We've compiled more information here: [Lockbourne Road](https://cssacpublicservices.org/lockbourne/)

# 3. South High Street between Greenlawn Ave and SR 104
**Category**: Roads

High Street on the South Side currently experiences high and unsafe vehicle speeds, resulting in frequent crashes. A road diet to address the high speeds and provide protected space for bicyclists is desired to improve the safety of everyone walking, biking, and driving along this corridor. South High Street is part of Zone In Phase 1 and is already seeing the construction of affordable housing along the corridor. We think safety improvements to the corridor are vital to support this growth. We've compiled more information here: [South High Street](https://cssacpublicservices.org/high/)

# 4. Parsons Avenue between Livingston Avenue and Hosack Street
**Category**: Sidewalks and/or Crosswalks

Design is currently underway for crosswalk enhancements at a few intersections along Parsons Avenue. We hope funding can be dedicated for the construction of these crosswalk enhancements, as well as additional traffic calming measures (additional crosswalks, medians/pedestrian refuge islands, etc) to ensure this important commercial corridor is safe for everyone. Lowering of the speed limit to 25 mph for all of Parsons Avenue is also important. We've compiled more information here: [Parsons Avenue](https://cssacpublicservices.org/parsons/)

# 5. Frebis Avenue bewteen Parsons Avenue and Alum Creek Drive
**Category**: Roads

A few years ago, the City completed a complete streets study of Frebis Avenue and made recommendations to reconfigure the roadway to improve safety for people walking and biking. We hope funding can be dedicated to make these improvements in the near term, as this is a potential major east-west bike corridor.
